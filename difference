Memory Locationz:
String literals are stored in the String Pool (heap). Other objects refer to existing objects.	New objects are created in the heap memory.
Object Creation:	
If the object already exists (like a string literal), it reuses the reference.	Always creates a new object in memory, even if one already exists.
Efficiency:	
More efficient because of string interning or reusing existing objects.	Less efficient, as it requires new memory allocation each time.
Example:
String s = "hello";	String s = new String("hello");
Memory Overhead:
Less overhead, as duplicates are avoided (interned).	More overhead, as new objects are created regardless of duplication.
